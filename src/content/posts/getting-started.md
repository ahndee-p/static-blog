# Getting Started with Web Development

*Published on February 8, 2024*

Web development can seem overwhelming at first, but starting with the basics is the best approach. In this post, we'll explore the fundamental building blocks of web development.

## The Basics

Every website starts with three core technologies:

1. **HTML** - Structure
2. **CSS** - Style
3. **JavaScript** - Interactivity

### HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of every webpage. Here's a simple example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### CSS

CSS makes your websites look good. Here's a basic example:

```css
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can explore:

Remember, the key is to practice regularly and build projects that interest you. Start small and gradually increase complexity as you learn.
